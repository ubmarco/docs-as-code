This section provides an overview of current process requirements and their clarification & implementation status.

.. note::
  All open issues and pull requests in the process repository are considered as if they
  are already part of the process requirements. They address a lot of the
  requirements that are referenced in this document, so we would be blocked if we would
  not consider them as part of the process requirements.

🗂️ Common Attributes
#####################

.. note::
  To stay consistent with sphinx-needs (the tool behind docs-as-code), we'll use `need`
  for any kind of model element like a requirement, an architecture element or a
  feature description.

  :parent_covered: NO

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that all Need IDs are globally unique across all included
  documentation instances.

  .. note::
     Within each docs-instance (as managed by sphinx-needs), IDs are guaranteed to be unique.
     When linking across instances, unique prefixes are automatically applied to maintain global uniqueness.

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that Need IDs follow the following naming scheme:

  * A prefix indicating the need type (e.g. `feature__`)
  * A middle part matching the hierarchical structure of the need:
     * For requirements: a portion of the feature tree or a component acronym
     * For architecture elements: the structural element (e.g. a part of the feature tree, component acronym)
     * For safety analysis (FMEA, DFA): name of analyzed structural element (e.g. Persistency, FEO, etc.)
  * Additional descriptive text to ensure human readability

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that each stakeholder requirement (stkh_req) contains a ``rationale`` attribute.

.. tool_req:: Enforces requirement type classification
  :id: tool_req__docs_req_attr_reqtype
  :tags: Requirements
  :implemented: YES
  :satisfies: gd_req__req_attr_type

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that each need of type :need:`tool_req__docs_req_types`
  except process and tool requirements has a ``reqtype`` attribute with one of the
  following values:

  * Functional
  * Interface
  * Process
  * Non-Functional

.. tool_req:: Enables marking requirements as "covered"
  :id: tool_req__docs_req_attr_reqcov
  :tags: Requirements
  :implemented: PARTIAL
  :satisfies: gd_req__req_attr_req_cov

  Docs as code shall shall enable marking requirements as covered by their linked children.

  Attribute ``reqcov`` must be one of the following values:
      * Yes
      * No

  .. note::
     No concept yet, as parents are generally not aware of their children.

.. tool_req:: Support requirements test coverage

  :implemented: PARTIAL
  :parent_covered: YES
  :satisfies: gd_req__req_attr_test_covered

  :parent_covered: YES
  :satisfies: gd_req__req_validity
  :status: valid

  Docs-as-Code shall enforce that ``valid_from`` is before ``valid_until`` attribute in stakeholder and feature requirements.
  We consider "from" is inclusive but "until" is exclusive, so from v0.5 until v1.0 means valid for v0.5 but not for v1.0.
  If either attribute is missing, no check is performed.

   :tags: Common Attributes
   :implemented: YES
   :parent_covered: YES
